# pi3d_spritesheet
Spritesheet animation using the pi3d library. The script is sprite.py, use 'python3 sprite.py' in terminal mode to run it.

This takes a large sprite, with 2 columns and 4 rows, and uses the UV offset to swap frames to create a flip-book style animation. It's doing this as a full screen image, so it simulates playing a movie. The movie is playing on a touchscreen device, so some code is in there to detect touches.
